# Dust Speck
This project was started upon discovering [Toni Sagrist√†'s blog post on procedural generation of planetary surfaces](https://tonisagrista.com/blog/2021/procedural-planetary-surfaces/).
The outcome is a Blender plugin that allows users to **procedurally generate textured planets**. Random elevation is generated using [simplex noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise).
The results can then be exported to any major game engine.
